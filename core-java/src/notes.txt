1. decision-making or conditional control statements
    1. if else
    2. switch

2. looping control statements :
    1. for loop
    2. while loop
    3. do while

    for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
        //for body

    }

    // condition --> direct, expression, variable, method call
    while(condition){
        //while body

    }


    do {
            //statements --> at least once
    } while(condition);


3. jump or transfer control statements
    1. break
    2. continue
    3. return


   break :
    - this is a keyword which is used only inside the loop and switch
    - whenever break statements executes it will be end of loop or switch
    - it is only end of loop or switch not the end of method
        node 1 --> node2 --> node3 --> node4 --> node1

   continue :
    - this is also keyword which is used only inside the loops otherwise CTE
    - whenever continue statement executes it will skip the current iteration, and it will continue from next iteration
    - it is not end of loop or method.

    return :
    - this is also a keyword which is used inside the method[if, else, switch, loops]
    - whenever return statement executes it will be end of method and control be transferred to caller method
    - it will be usually last statement in the method.
    - it used to return some value to the caller method.
        - syntax : return value
                     - value can be  : direct value, expression, variable, method call
